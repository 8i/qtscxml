- qscxmlc doesn't give an error when the target of a transition is not found/known.
- add test to scxml validation failures.
- add a signal for <invoke target="qt:signal:name"/>

- only process the scxml namespace, and don't complain about other namespaces

- document qt:classname property and its schema/namespace
- go over the TODOs/FIXMEs
- probably rename ScxmlParser to Scxml::Parser
- rename StateTable to something like Scxml::StateMachine
- check if the use of namespaces is according to Qt standards
- code review
- qmake review
- QML: move the parsing & instantiation of the state machine to a separate thread (if it wasn't created in C++ of course)
